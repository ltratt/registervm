  Register VM
============================================================================

Execute the VM thus in normal Python:

  python VM.py <file> [<arg1> ... <argn>]

If you want to build an RPython VM, you will need to have downloaded PyPy
from source:

  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy

And then set the PYPY_SRC variable to wherever that directory is. e.g.:

  cd ~/tmp
  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
  export PYPY_SRC=~/tmp/pypy

then you can do a translation in the directory with the VM.py file:

  python $PYPY_SRC/rpython/bin/rpython -Ojit --output=regvm VM.py

[If you have the pypy binary installed, you will find the above command runs
much faster if you replace "python" with "pypy".]

Then you can run the version with a JIT:

  ./regvm fact.rm 7
